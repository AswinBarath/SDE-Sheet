## Note taking - Ground rules

- `Topicwise`, note down what type of `problem` uses which `pattern` to be solved via which type of `optimization`
```
Topicwise: Problem - Pattern - Optimization
```
- Problem Solving Goal on Day-to-Day basis: 
```
3 hours / day         =  6 Questions per day
6 Q's / day     * 30  =  180 Questions per month
180 Q's / month * 4   =  720 Questions in 4 months
```
- Problem Solving is more important than note making, so don't stress too much in notes/documentation
