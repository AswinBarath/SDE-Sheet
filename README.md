## 🔴 Striver's SDE Sheet

- **Myth**: You should be really good at competitive programming
- **Reality**:
    - Solving a bunch of 150-200 questions from GFG or Leetcode can get you stronger at Data Structures and Algorithms
    - Solving 150-200 questions gets your problem solving skills up
    - Because you are covering every Algorithm, you are covering Data Structure, you are covering every topic that could be possibly asked in the interview
    - So, once you are done with this 150 - 200 questions, what happens is, you are really good at your problem-solving skills or you are really good at your data structures and algorithms skills
    - And apparently, you are able to crack those interviews
    - This 150 - 200 questions helps you crack the majority of the product based companies in India
- Striver's SDE Sheet: [takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/)
- This 180 questions will take you 1 month (30 days) if you are already into programming.
- For every day, you need to around 8 to 10 hours, a proper 8 to 10 hours.
- You should be able to spend 8 to 10 hours because you are wanting to get into India's top most companies and for that you have to sacrifice 8 to 10 hours per day for around 30 to 60 days (1 - 2 months).
- If you cannot do this, then product based companies do not deserve you, there might be someone else who is waiting for you.
- So, if you spend 8 - 10 hours per day to solve 6 questions for 30 days without having any cheat days in between, You would have solved 180 questions at the end of the 30 days.
- After that 30 days, you should be really good at DSA and you should be able to crack any of the product based companies' interviews.
- You have the list, how will you solve the problems:
    - Let's say, you are solving the problem *find the middle of Linked list*
    - Search for "*middle of Linked list leetcode*" on google
    - Open the leetcode problem link, try to solve the problem
    - Now, for best solution go to the *Discuss Section* and search for *Most Votes*
    - Sometimes you can go to Solution section of Leetcode
    - If you are not satisfied with those places for solutions, search "*middle of Linked list gfg*" on google
    - Go to the GFG article and refer the best solutions
- Source of questions: 
    - Striver's interview Experience,
    - Leetcode premium (lists),
    - Striver's work experience at GFG

## Note taking Tips from Striver

- Take a notepad, whenever you are solving a problem and you have successfully solved the problem on Leetcode or GFG, do this:
    - Write a function snippet in your notepad
    - So, what eventually happens is that after 180 questions, all these questions function snippets will be in your notepad
    - Now, make sure that every morning you should revise it (**Apply Active Recall study technique**)
- Doing this on the first day may take you 4 hours, 
    - the next day it might take you 3 hours, 
    - and the next day it will surely take you 2 hours, 
    - on the next day it will take you 1 hour and 
    - eventually a day will come where it will hardly take 10 - 15 minutes. 
    - You will be just crawling thourgh the pages and you will totally get it 
    - and everything will stay in your mind
- Don't memorize it, instead:
    - remember the approaches for the solving the problems,
    - remember the best complextity
- So, if you remember the approaches, you have your implementation skills, you can easily implement in the interview
- So, you should keep revising in the notepad on a daily basis
- Keep doing this till you are interviewing with companies

## Interview Prep Requirements

- **Striver's Core Sheet**: [takeuforward.org/interviews/must-do-questions-for-dbms-cn-os-interviews-sde-core-sheet/](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/must-do-questions-for-dbms-cn-os-interviews-sde-core-sheet/)
- **Core Subjects**: DBMS, Computer Networks, Operating Systems
- Prepare notes from Striver's Core Sheet Website above
- **Resume**:
    - Make sure to write those things in resume which you can answer if the interviewer asks you
- **Projects**: 
    - You should be ready with a reason for each project you created
    - Which tech stack you have used, and say why you preferred this tech stack and what other tech stacks did you consider
    - What are the difficulties you faced in your projects and what did you do to overcome them
    - So, create a script of 4 - 5 pages on above points for your projects
    - The interviewer will judge on briefing skills, how are you representing the project
- **Problem solving rounds**:
    - If you know the given problem, do not jump into the solution directly: 
        - because this will make the interviewer change the question 
        - and it throws a negative impression that you do not know how to represent yourself in the interview
    - So, intially start off with the Brute-force approach:
        - Say the brute-force approach to the interviewer
        - Run some test cases on your brute-force approach
        - Say the time complexity and space complexity
        - Two things may happen:
            - The interviewer may ask you to code the brute-force
            - Or might ask you to make the brute-force approach better
    - Now, spend 5 to 10 minutes to present your thought process to getting towards the optimal appraoch
        - Write some test cases 
        - Do some dry run
    - Now, you give the efficient approach to the interviewer. Once he is satisfied, provide the time complexity and space complexity
    - Now, the interviewer will ask you to code it:
        - Do not blindly write the code, that's a common mistake
        - Ask the interviewer that "Should I only write the function?" or "Should I write the entire code?"
        - Most of the cases, the interviewer will say "Yes" to write function snippet
        - Now, you write the code snippet in such a way that you are in the ears of the interviewer every time:
            - When you write the function, you tell him this function will do this and this
            - If you take two parameters, tell him that the 1st parameter is this and 2nd parameter is this, intially I will pass this and this
            - Tell him you are intiializing this and this
            - Do this until he/she says "please write the code and then once you are done then you can explain"
    - This process of interviewing send them the message that **you actually want the job and you are really prepared and you are really motivated to bag it**

## Note taking - Ground rules

- `Topicwise`, note down what type of `problem` uses which `pattern` to be solved via which type of `optimization`
```
Topicwise: Problem - Pattern - Optimization
```
- Problem Solving Goal on Day-to-Day basis: 
```
3 hours / day         =  6 Questions per day
6 Q's / day     * 30  =  180 Questions per month
180 Q's / month * 4   =  720 Questions in 4 months
```
- Problem Solving is more important than note making, so don't stress too much in notes/documentation
